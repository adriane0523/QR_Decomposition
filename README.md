<h1>SVD and QR decomposition</h1>
<p>The purpose of this script was to compute QR which will help compute SVD to assist vein
image scanning calculations for the CAVA lab at Phoenix's Children Hospital. The script does not use any other libraries (like NumPy) due to space and computation time. 
The SVD/QR library were both built-in python, C/C++. However, the python library is a lot more developed than the C/C++ library.</p>
